R-studio default and non-default predictive modelling:
The main projects agenda is to predict the applicants into default and non-default which is mostly used by the insurance companies to understand the prediction of financial institutions whom they provide insurance to and understanding their prediction is absolutely necessary to maintain strong financial returns and optimize the existing returns for the entities.
EDA analysis:
Basic summary statistics like mean, median, max, min and finally standard deviation are calculated and the necessary data has been plotted where box-plot and histogram have majorly been used to understand the distribution and how their distribution vary as well.
The libraries used include ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr and coorplot for understanding the patterns in the data and after clear visualizations regression models have been performed as the questions why are the applicants despite having good financial standing and credit scores denied loans as they are classified as defaults and why are applicants with poor financial standing and credit score granted loans as they are classified into non-defaults. The statistical models performed include Random forest model, decision tree and logistic regression model and the libraries used include tidymodels, rpart and VIP. Out of all the models the decision tree models predicts more accurately where it has identified defaults who are incorrectly classified into non-defaults and non-defaults incorrectly classified as defaults as well. 
From the overall this model can help any financial and insurance agencies predict accurately and our learned include how to efficiently use R to deliver the best insights and classify the applicants accurately.
